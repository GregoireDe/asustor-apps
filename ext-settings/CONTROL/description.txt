Extended Settings for ADM OS Portal.

Note:

Configure "settings.conf" file in "/share/Ext Settings"

Current settings are
- (EXT4) Disk Warning threshold (EXT4). Default: 90%
- (EXT4) Disk Limit threshold (EXT4). Default: 95%
- (BTRFS) Free Disk Limit threshold. Default 5%

/!\ For BTRFS, it's highly recommended to keep a minimum free space in order for that system storage to work correctly
